          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The dataset includes data about median age, median household
            income, poverty, obesity, smoking, and access to health care insurance
            by State.</p>

          <p>The data shows States with higher poverty level are generally more likely to lack healthcare
            insurance. While States with lower poverty level are generally less likely to lack healthcare.
            Texas ranks first in poverty level at 17.2% while having 24.9% of it's population who lack healthcare, while Massachusetts has the lowest poverty level at 11.6% while only 4.6% lack healthcare.</p>

          <p>I also findd a correlation between age and smoking, the data shows people between 36 and 40 have a higher percent of smokers amongs all the States.
            Another interisting trend, those States having a lower household income tend to have a higher percentage of smokers, while States having a higher household income have a lower smoker percentage.</p>
